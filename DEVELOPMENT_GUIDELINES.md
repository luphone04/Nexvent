# Development Guidelines

## Frontend Development Principles

### Keep It Simple & Clean
- **Simplicity First**: Don't overcomplicate the code - prioritize clean, readable solutions over complex architectures
- **Not Too Serious**: This is a functional application, not enterprise-grade software - keep the approach pragmatic
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid adding unnecessary libraries or frameworks unless truly needed
- **Clean Code**: Write code that's easy to understand and maintain, even if it's not the most "advanced" solution

### Frontend Specific Guidelines
- Use straightforward component structures
- Avoid over-engineering state management
- Keep styling simple and functional
- Focus on working features over perfect abstractions
- Write components that are easy to understand at first glance

### Remember
- **Working > Perfect**: A simple solution that works is better than a complex one that's hard to maintain
- **Readable > Clever**: Code should be obvious, not impressive
- **Functional > Fancy**: Focus on user experience and functionality over flashy features
